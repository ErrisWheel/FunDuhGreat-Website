            With a background in both the sciences and technology, I've developed a unique set of skills that bridges these two fields. My journey has led me to learn various programming languages, and I’ve even delved into robotics. I’ve acquired proficiency in:

        <p style="font-family: Impact; font-size: 32px; color: black; margin: 0; text-align: left; font-weight: bold;">My Journey from Medical Laboratory Science to Information Technology</p>
        <p style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: black; margin: 20px 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 20px;">
            My journey into the world of Information Technology started long before I even considered transitioning from Medical Laboratory Science (Med Lab Sci). At the age of 5, I had my first gaming console. By 6, I got my first laptop, and even though no one taught me how to use these devices—no manuals, no guidance—I instinctively knew how to operate them. This curiosity grew as I got older, and by the time I had my first PC, I was already cracking it open to learn how it worked, understanding the function of each component.
        </p>
        <p style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: black; margin: 20px 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 20px;">
            Computers, to me, are like humans: we have our brains, processing information and controlling everything, just like a computer's CPU. The more I learned about computers, the more fascinated I became by their design, function, and how they can solve problems. While I initially thought pursuing a field like MLS or medicine would be fulfilling, I realized it wasn’t as fun or exciting for me anymore. IT felt like the natural next step for me, as it aligns with my passion for technology and my deep understanding of how systems work—whether it’s a human body or a computer.
        </p>
        <p style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: black; margin: 20px 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 20px;">
            This hands-on experience and innate curiosity about technology led me to pursue IT, where I could combine my problem-solving skills with the world of tech to innovate and create solutions.
        </p>
        <p style="font-family: Impact; font-size: 32px; color: black; margin: 0; text-align: left; font-weight: bold;">My Journey as a Freelancer</p>
        <p style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: black; margin: 20px 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 20px;">
            I’ve been a freelancer for a few years now, diving into the world of tech with a focus on building PCs, configuring BIOS settings, and overclocking systems. Although I haven’t made a single cent from it yet, the experiences I’ve gained have been invaluable. My passion for computers and technology has driven me to offer my services to friends, relatives, and even strangers who needed guidance or a custom-built system tailored to their needs.
        </p>
        <p style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: black; margin: 20px 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 20px;">
            One of the most rewarding parts of my freelance work has been helping friends and family with their tech needs. I’ve recommended, built, and fine-tuned PCs to match their specific requirements—whether it's for gaming, productivity, or just everyday use. Over the years, I’ve gained an in-depth understanding of hardware compatibility, system optimization, and how to get the best performance out of every component.
        </p>
        <p style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: black; margin: 20px 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 20px;">
            Aside from building systems, I’ve spent time configuring BIOS settings to ensure that each PC is running at its peak potential. I’ve even ventured into the world of overclocking, tweaking hardware to push limits while maintaining system stability. All of this has helped me refine my problem-solving skills and deepened my knowledge of how computers work—from the inside out.
        </p>
        <p style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: black; margin: 20px 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 20px;">
        The experience and satisfaction of building systems and sharing knowledge have been incredibly fulfilling. I’ve been able to apply what I’ve learned from personal projects to assist others while simultaneously expanding my own technical expertise. This journey has only strengthened my desire to pursue a career in IT, where I can continue helping others while working on even larger-scale projects. Emphasis on FREE, because I haven’t earned a single cent, those cheap bastards.

        <p style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: black; margin: 20px 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 20px;">
            I was born in Bulacan, christened in Pampanga, and raised in Tarlac. Now, I live in Holy Spirit, Quezon City. My academic journey has taken me through various institutions, each playing a role in shaping my passion for technology.
        </p>
        <p style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: black; margin: 20px 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 20px;">
            I graduated from Great Eastern Institute as a STEM student in senior high school, where my love for science and technology continued to grow. In 2023, I enrolled at Far Eastern University – Nicanor Reyes Medical Foundation (FEU-NRMF) as a Medical Laboratory Science student. However, by December 2024, I realized that while the field was fascinating, it just wasn’t fun for me anymore.
        </p>
        <p style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: black; margin: 20px 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 20px;">
            In January 2025, I decided to fully embrace my passion and transferred to Technological Institute of the Philippines (TIP) Quezon City to pursue a degree in Information Technology. This transition wasn’t a sudden change of interest—I’ve been into computers since childhood. At age 5, I got my first gaming console. At 6, I had my first laptop. No one taught me how to use them, I didn’t even read the manuals, yet I somehow just knew. A few years later, I got my first PC, cracked it open, and figured out how everything worked, from the motherboard to the RAM sticks.
        </p>
        <p style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: black; margin: 20px 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 20px;">
            One of the schools that strengthened my passion for computers was FEU Diliman, where I took a summer program in Programming and Robotics in 2019. It fueled my curiosity and made me dive deeper into coding and hardware. In fact, it’s the reason I’m going over the top and getting carried away with creating this HTML site—so I can prove to my parents that the money they spent on that summer program and my PC was totally worth it. Also, let’s be honest... I need them to understand that I *really* need a new one.
